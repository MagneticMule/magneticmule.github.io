Part art installation, part 80's revivalist nostalgia, MYGO was an attempt to recreate the feeling of being in a video arcade. It took place in a large shopping centre, smack bang in the middle of Nottingham City center. As a result, we attracted a large number of folk who wouldn't normally engage with traditional installation based art.
