Inspired heavily by Myst and the recently released (at the time) Riven, Time was my attempt to create a puzzle game using pre-rendered graphics and sound. Of course, like many before and after me I failed to think seriously about the time needed to create such an experience. I was the graphic designer, programmer, game designer, sound artist and musician at a time long before the successful indie scene. Despite consuming over two years of my life, Time was never finished. All that remains are a few stolen screenshits taken at a public demo some years later.
