Inspired heavily by Myst and itâ€™s recently released (at that time) sequel Riven, Time was my attempt to create a puzzle game using pre-rendered graphics, captured sound and self composed music. Of course, like many before and after me I failed to think seriously about the time needed to create such an experience. I was the graphic designer, programmer, game designer, sound artist and musician at a time long before the successful indie game scene. Despite consuming over two years of my life, Time was never finished. All that remains are these few stolen screenshots taken at a public demo some years later.
